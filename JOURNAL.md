## Session 6 - 01 April 2026 - Schedule & Availability Page

### What was built
- `public.availability` table created in Supabase with RLS policies (teachers manage own availability, admins manage all)
- Unique constraint added to prevent duplicate general slots per teacher/day/time
- `src/app/(dashboard)/schedule/page.tsx` - server component fetching availability from Supabase
- `src/app/(dashboard)/schedule/ScheduleClient.tsx` - tab shell with manual tab implementation (replaced shadcn Tabs due to Tailwind v4 incompatibility)
- `src/app/(dashboard)/schedule/tabs/GeneralAvailability.tsx` - weekly recurring grid with click and click-drag multi-select, instant visual feedback, batch save to Supabase on mouse release
- `src/app/(dashboard)/schedule/tabs/DayToDay.tsx` - FullCalendar week view with recurring availability as background tint, specific available/unavailable blocks, booked classes with student names, Add Availability/Unavailability mode buttons, now indicator (current time red line), 30-minute slot increments
- `src/app/(dashboard)/schedule/tabs/Holidays.tsx` - date range picker, validation, planned unavailability list with delete, warning banner about existing bookings
- `src/components/layout/TopHeader.tsx` - updated to solid Lingualink orange (#FF8303) background with white text and logo

### Break/Fix Log

**Issue 1**
- Symptom: ScheduleClient.tsx threw a parse error on load
- Cause: Instructional text from chat was accidentally pasted into the file alongside the code
- Fix: Replaced entire file with clean code only
- Lesson: Always verify file contents after pasting - editor gives no warning if non-code text is present

**Issue 2**
- Symptom: shadcn Tabs component rendered unstyled with labels merging together
- Cause: Tailwind v4 does not apply shadcn component styles reliably without additional configuration
- Fix: Replaced shadcn Tabs with a manually built tab implementation using plain buttons and state
- Lesson: shadcn components may need extra setup with Tailwind v4 - when a component misbehaves visually, a manual implementation is faster than debugging the CSS pipeline

**Issue 3**
- Symptom: General availability slots switching tabs wiped data from other tabs
- Cause: Each tab was receiving only its filtered slice of the availability array and passing that slice back to the parent on save, overwriting all other records
- Fix: All tabs now receive the full availability array and merge their changes back into the full list before calling onAvailabilityChange
- Lesson: When multiple components share a parent state, every component must be aware of the full state - never pass a filtered subset and expect it to merge correctly on the way back up

**Issue 4**
- Symptom: General availability times appearing incorrectly on Day to Day calendar (e.g. Monday showing 6:00 - 2:00)
- Cause: toISOString() converts dates to UTC before returning a string - in Cape Town (UTC+2) this shifts the date backward, placing slots on the wrong day and wrong time
- Fix: Replaced toISOString() with a toLocalDateStr() function that builds the date string directly from local date parts, bypassing UTC conversion entirely. Added timeZone="local" to FullCalendar
- Lesson: Never use toISOString() when working with local dates. Cape Town is UTC+2 so any date operation using UTC will be off by 2 hours - enough to shift a slot to the previous day late at night

**Issue 5**
- Symptom: Monday column appeared darker than other days on Day to Day calendar
- Cause: Drag testing created duplicate general slots for Monday in the database - stacked background events multiplied the opacity of the tint
- Fix: Deleted duplicates via SQL (keeping one record per unique teacher/day/start/end combination), then added a UNIQUE constraint to prevent recurrence
- Lesson: Always add database-level constraints to enforce business rules - application-level checks alone are not enough if data can be written from multiple places

### Session result
Built the complete Schedule & Availability page across three tabs. General Availability uses a custom click-and-drag weekly grid that saves recurring slots directly to Supabase. Day to Day uses FullCalendar with timezone-safe date handling for Cape Town, showing recurring availability as a background tint and booked classes with student names. Holidays provides a date range picker with validation and a deletable planned unavailability list. A database unique constraint was added after duplicate slots were discovered during testing. The top header was updated to solid Lingualink orange across all pages.

## Session 5 - 01 April 2026 - Upcoming Classes Page with Live Data

### What was built
- `src/app/(dashboard)/upcoming-classes/page.tsx` - server component that fetches upcoming classes from Supabase and passes data to the client component
- `src/app/(dashboard)/upcoming-classes/UpcomingClassesClient.tsx` - client component rendering collapsible day groups, class cards, live countdown timers, expand/collapse chevrons, and action buttons (Reschedule, Chat, Join Class)
- `public.classes` table created in Supabase with RLS policies (teachers see own classes, admins see all)
- `teacher_id` column added to existing `public.trainings` table via ALTER TABLE
- Test data seeded: 2 students (Marie Dubois, Hans Müller), 2 trainings, 3 upcoming classes linked to the logged-in teacher

### Break/Fix Log

**Issue 1**
- Symptom: Seed data failed with `column "teacher_id" of relation "trainings" does not exist`
- Cause: The trainings table was created in a previous session without the teacher_id column
- Fix: Used `ALTER TABLE public.trainings ADD COLUMN teacher_id uuid references public.profiles(id)` to add the missing column
- Lesson: When tables already exist from a previous session, check their structure before running inserts that depend on new columns

**Issue 2**
- Symptom: Build error - `Expected a semicolon` at the href attribute inside the Join Class anchor tag
- Cause: Pasting code from chat into Cursor corrupted the curly brace characters inside JSX attributes
- Fix: Replaced the anchor tag with a button using `window.open()` in an onClick handler, which avoided the problematic JSX attribute syntax entirely
- Lesson: When the same paste error occurs twice, change the approach rather than re-pasting the same code

**Issue 3**
- Symptom: Collapse chevron arrows rendering as huge oversized icons
- Cause: Tailwind v4 does not reliably constrain SVG size with `w-4 h-4` utility classes
- Fix: Extracted chevrons into a dedicated `ChevronIcon` component using explicit `width="16" height="16"` HTML attributes and inline `style` for rotation, bypassing Tailwind entirely for SVG sizing
- Lesson: In Tailwind v4, always use explicit width/height attributes on SVGs rather than utility classes

### Session result
Built the first real feature page of the LinguaLink portal - the Upcoming Classes dashboard. The page fetches live data from Supabase, groups classes by day, displays collapsible day sections and individual class cards with real-time countdown timers. Three test students and classes were seeded into the database to validate the full data flow from Supabase through to the UI. All changes pushed to the dev branch on GitHub.

## Session 4 - 1 April 2026 - Brand Colours, Layout Shell & Navigation

### What was built
- Brand colours registered in `src/app/globals.css` under the `@theme inline` block using Tailwind v4 syntax — `brand-orange`, `brand-orange-light`, `brand-red`, `brand-yellow`, `brand-yellow-light`, `brand-grey`
- Dashboard layout created at `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` - fetches the authenticated user's profile from Supabase server-side and passes name, photo URL, and role down to all layout components. Automatically wraps every page inside the `(dashboard)` route group
- Left navigation component created at `src/components/layout/LeftNav.tsx` - all 9 nav items with icons, active route highlighted in Lingualink orange, Admin Controls visible to admin role only, unread badge on Messages, Log Out button pinned to the bottom
- Top header component created at `src/components/layout/TopHeader.tsx` - logo placeholder on the left, first name greeting and profile photo on the right, photo links to My Account
- Right panel component created at `src/components/layout/RightPanel.tsx` - real-time countdown timer to next class using `setInterval`, Join Class button logic set to appear 15 minutes before class, billing summary section, What's New section, Help & Support section
- Middleware file renamed from `src/middleware.ts` to `src/proxy.ts` and exported function renamed from `middleware` to `proxy` to comply with Next.js 16 requirements
- Layout shell confirmed working in browser - all components rendering correctly with Lingualink branding
- All code committed and pushed to GitHub on dev branch

### Break/Fix Log

**Issue 1**
- Symptom: `tailwind.config.ts` not found in project root
- Cause: Project uses Tailwind v4, which removed the config file entirely and moved all configuration into CSS
- Fix: Added brand colour variables directly to the `@theme inline` block in `src/app/globals.css` instead
- Lesson: Always check the Tailwind version before looking for a config file - v4 works differently from v3

**Issue 2**
- Symptom: Dev server warning on startup - "The middleware file convention is deprecated. Please use proxy instead"
- Cause: Next.js 16 renamed `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts` and requires the exported function to also be named `proxy`
- Fix: Renamed the file using `mv src/middleware.ts src/proxy.ts` and updated the exported function name from `middleware` to `proxy`
- Lesson: Renaming the file alone is not enough - the exported function name must also be updated to match

**Issue 3**
- Symptom: `git push` rejected with "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally"
- Cause: JOURNAL.md had been edited directly on GitHub the night before, so the remote branch was ahead of local
- Fix: Ran `git pull origin dev` to pull and merge the remote changes, then pushed successfully
- Lesson: Always pull before pushing if you have edited any files directly on GitHub

### Session result
Brand colours registered and available across the entire project, layout shell fully built and confirmed working in the browser with correct Lingualink branding, role-based nav filtering working correctly for Shannon's admin account, and all code pushed to GitHub on the dev branch.

## Session 3 - 31 March 2026 - Supabase Client, Database Schema & Authentication

### What was built
- Supabase browser client created at `src/lib/supabase/client.ts`
- Supabase server client created at `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`
- Middleware created at `src/middleware.ts` — refreshes user sessions on every request and handles route protection
- Full database schema written and executed in Supabase SQL Editor - 13 tables created: `profiles`, `students`, `trainings`, `training_teachers`, `lessons`, `reports`, `study_sheets`, `exercises`, `assignments`, `availability_templates`, `availability_overrides`, `invoices`, `messages`
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all 13 tables with policies ensuring teachers can only access their own data
- Automatic profile creation trigger set up — a profile row is created in the `profiles` table whenever a new auth user is added
- Login page built at `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` with Lingualink branding - orange button, Poppins font, grey background
- Server action for authentication created at `src/app/(auth)/login/actions.ts`
- Placeholder dashboard page created at `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Poppins font added to global layout in `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Shannon's test user created in Supabase Auth, profile updated to role `admin`
- Login tested and confirmed working end-to-end
- All code committed and pushed to GitHub on dev branch

### Break/Fix Log

**Issue 1**
- Symptom: Build error on the login page - `Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/ui/card'`
- Cause: shadcn/ui components are not installed automatically - each component must be added individually using the CLI
- Fix: Ran `npx shadcn@latest add card button input label` in a second terminal while the dev server was still running in the first
- Lesson: Always install shadcn/ui components before importing them. Initialising shadcn does not pre-install any components

**Issue 2**
- Symptom: PowerShell threw an error when running `ls src/app/(auth)/`
- Cause: PowerShell interprets brackets as command syntax, not as part of a file path
- Fix: Wrapped the path in single quotes - `ls 'src/app/(auth)/'`
- Lesson: On Windows PowerShell, always quote paths that contain parentheses

**Issue 3**
- Symptom: Dashboard displayed Role: teacher for Shannon instead of Role: admin
- Cause: The database trigger creates the profile row automatically when a user is added, but defaults the role to `teacher` - it has no way of knowing the intended role
- Fix: Manually edited Shannon's row in the Supabase Table Editor and set the role field to `admin`
- Lesson: After creating an admin user in Supabase Auth, always manually update their role in the profiles table immediately after

### Session result
Supabase client fully configured, all 13 database tables live, authentication working end-to-end with role-based access confirmed, login page styled in Lingualink branding, and all code pushed to GitHub.

## Session 2 - 31 March 2026 - Next.js Initialisation

### What was built
- Backed up `.env.local` before initialisation to avoid losing credentials
- Moved conflicting files (`.env.local`, `.github/`, `README.md`) out of the project folder temporarily to allow Next.js to initialise cleanly
- Initialised Next.js 16.2.1 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, App Router, and src directory
- Installed Supabase packages: `@supabase/supabase-js` and `@supabase/ssr`
- Installed Sentry: `@sentry/nextjs`
- Initialised shadcn/ui with the Nova preset
- Created full folder structure inside `src/`: `app/(auth)/login`, `app/(dashboard)`, `app/api`, `components/layout`, `components/shared`, `hooks`, `lib`, `types`
- Restored `.env.local` with all 7 variables correctly named and prefixed: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `SENTRY_DSN`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `NODE_ENV`
- Confirmed app running at `localhost:3000`
- Pushed to GitHub, CI passing green on dev branch

### Break/Fix Log

**Issue 1**
- Symptom: `npx create-next-app` refused to run, reporting that the directory contained conflicting files
- Cause: `.env.local`, `.github/`, and `README.md` already existed in the project folder from the previous session
- Fix: Used `Move-Item` in PowerShell to temporarily move all three files out of the folder, ran the initialisation, then moved them back with `Move-Item -Force`
- Lesson: `create-next-app` cannot initialise into a folder that already contains files it expects to create - always move conflicting files out first when initialising into an existing repo

**Issue 2**
- Symptom: `mkdir` commands for `(auth)` and `(dashboard)` folders threw `CommandNotFoundException` errors
- Cause: PowerShell interprets parentheses as command syntax, not as part of a folder name
- Fix: Wrapped the paths in quotes: `mkdir "src/app/(auth)/login"` and `mkdir "src/app/(dashboard)"`
- Lesson: On Windows PowerShell, any folder name containing parentheses must be quoted in mkdir commands

**Issue 3**
- Symptom: shadcn `init` stopped without completing when the Custom preset was selected
- Cause: The Custom preset requires a pre-built configuration from the shadcn website - it cannot complete locally without that
- Fix: Re-ran `npx shadcn@latest init` and selected the Nova preset instead. Brand colours will be applied manually in the global CSS file during the UI build phase
- Lesson: Use an existing shadcn preset as a starting point and override colours in CSS - do not use the Custom preset without a pre-built configuration

### Session result
Next.js application successfully initialised with the full agreed stack, folder structure in place, environment variables confirmed, app running locally, and first real commit pushed to GitHub with CI passing.

## Session 1 - 31 March 2026 - Environment Setup

### What was built
- GitHub repository created at github.com/LeopoldTydtgat/lingualink-lms with README, .gitignore, and MIT license
- Main branch protected, dev branch created as the daily working branch
- Git configured locally with name, email, and SSH authentication to GitHub
- Project cloned to `C:\Projects\lingualink-lms` - intentionally outside OneDrive
- PowerShell execution policy updated to allow npm scripts to run
- Cursor Pro opened, connected to correct project folder, workspace trusted, confirmed on dev branch
- Node.js v24.14.1 and npm v11.11.0 confirmed working
- Vercel account connected to GitHub, lingualink-lms repository imported, auto-deploy active on dev branch
- Supabase project confirmed, publishable and secret API keys collected
- `.env.local` created with Supabase credentials
- Resend account confirmed, domain lingualinkonline.com verified in EU West (Ireland) region, DNS records added, API key saved to `.env.local`
- Sentry project created for Next.js, DSN key saved to `.env.local`
- GitHub Actions CI workflow created at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, pushed to dev branch, workflow triggered and passed successfully

### Break/Fix Log

**Issue 1**
- Symptom: Project folder was inside OneDrive.
- Cause: Folder was created in the default Windows documents location which syncs automatically to OneDrive
- Fix: Created `C:\Projects` directory outside OneDrive and cloned the repository there instead
- Lesson: Never put Git repositories inside OneDrive - background sync causes file conflicts and potential corruption

**Issue 2**
- Symptom: `npm --version` returned a security error - script could not be loaded
- Cause: Windows PowerShell execution policy is set to restricted by default, blocking npm scripts from running
- Fix: Ran `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
- Lesson: Windows requires explicit permission to run PowerShell scripts - this is a one-time fix per machine

**Issue 3**
- Symptom: Cursor was pointing at the old OneDrive folder, not the cloned repository
- Cause: Cursor had been opened previously with the wrong folder path
- Fix: File → Open Folder → navigated to `C:\Projects\lingualink-lms`
- Lesson: Always confirm Cursor is pointing at the correct project folder at the start of each session

**Issue 4**
- Symptom: API key accidentally pasted into chat and then into the terminal instead of `.env.local`
- Cause: Unfamiliarity with the workflow - the copied value went to the wrong destination twice
- Fix: Deleted the exposed keys on Resend immediately, generated fresh keys, and pasted them directly into `.env.local`
- Lesson: API keys go directly into `.env.local` only - never in chat, the terminal, or any other file

**Issue 5**
- Symptom: Confusion about whether Payfast needed to be integrated into the portal
- Cause: The brief mentioned Payfast but Shannon's actual business flow handles payments on the existing WordPress website separately
- Fix: Confirmed with Shannon that the portal never handles money - students pay on the website and Shannon activates accounts manually in the portal
- Lesson: Always validate brief requirements against the actual business workflow - Shannon's confirmed process overrides what the brief says

### Session result
All development tools configured and connected end-to-end, credentials secured in `.env.local`, CI pipeline live on GitHub, and one major scope decision confirmed - the portal has no payment integration.
